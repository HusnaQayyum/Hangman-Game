Created a dictionary named stocks to store stock symbols along with their prices.

Initialized a variable total_investment with 0 to keep track of the total amount invested.

Opened a file named portfolio.txt in write mode so that I can save the stock details and total investment.

Displayed the available stock names so the user knows which stocks can be selected.

Used a while True loop to allow entering multiple stocks continuously.

Asked the user to enter a stock name.

If the user enters done, stop taking input and exit the loop.

Checked whether the entered stock exists in the dictionary.

If it exists, asked for the quantity.

Calculated the investment by multiplying stock price and quantity.

Added this value to total_investment.

Saved the stock name, quantity, and price into the file.

If the stock name does not exist, showed a message saying “Stock not available”.

After exiting the loop, I wrote the total investment value into the file.

Finally, closed the file and displayed the total investment on the screen
